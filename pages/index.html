<page xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Friendly Server-side JavaScript">

<p>Welcome to ESXX, the free, easy-to-install, easy-to-use, no-nonsense
JavaScript/ECMAscript application server! ESXX is currenlty in 
<strong>beta stage</strong>, which means that the APIs should now be
stable, although maybe not fully complete.</p>

<p>Even though there is still a lot of work left before we leave beta,
ESXX is stable, very usable, used in production and well worth a
try!</p>

<p>ESXX is available under the GPL license, version 3 or later. Non-GPL
licenses and various support options will be available later.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
ESXX is pronounced <em>Essex</em> and is a Java-based web application
server that executes web applications written in JavaScript
(a.k.a. ECMAscript) on the server side. It's available for Linux, OS X,
Solaris, Windows and any other platform where Java 6 is available.</p>

<h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>

<p>Server-side JavaScript was first introduced by Netscape in 1996, but
has evolved <em>a lot</em> since then and is today an excellent language
for rapid web development, especially when it comes to processing XML
data, where E4X makes it nothing but outstanding.</p>

<p>Combined with the fantastic Java 6 runtime, it provides everything a
developer could ever wish for, in an agile, geeky kind of way.</p>

<h3>Why ESXX?</h3>

<p>ESXX is all about making it easier to write secure, scalable and
robust web services than it is not to, yet never stand in the way of the
developer's creativity.</p>

<p>The goal is to let you deliver production-ready code faster and
cheaper. ESXX is easy to learn, easy to use and easy to deploy. Please
read the <a href="tech.html">technical introduction</a> for a more
in-depth overview of what ESXX is what it can do for you.</p>
