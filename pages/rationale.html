<page xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Rationale">

<p>This page tries to explain some of the design decisions made while
developing ESXX.</p>


<h2>Filter chains</h2>

<p>While sometimes useful, invoking custom filters is just one line of
code, right before or after the actual request processing code. So
instead of specifying filter rules in some distant XML file, you specify
it right in the request handler. I believe that's a more suitable place
for it.</p>


<h2>O/R mapping</h2>

<p>An object-relational mapper tries to make a relational database into
something that it isn't. ESXX uses a dynamically typed language and XML,
so working directly with SQL databases is really easy. And by using a
hand-designed database schema, your database is easily accessible from
other programs and languages as well.</p>

<p>Much can be said in this matter, but my view is that relational
databases should be used the way they were designed to be used, and that
you should write your applications accordingly. If all you need is a way
to store your objects and and able to retrieve them by key or simple
queries, an index databases such as <dfn>Lucene</dfn>
or <dfn>Xapian</dfn> could be another option.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<p>Pretending the RDMS is an object storage easily results in suboptimal
perfromance, no matter if automatic object-relational mapping is used or
not.  Consider the following example, from the Spring MVC tutorial.
(Admittedly, MVC-step-by-step is just a tutorial, but isn't the whole
point of a tutorial to show how to best use your product?)</p>

<pre class="example">// From ProductManager.java in MVC-step-by-step
public void increasePrice(int pct) {
    ListIterator li = products.listIterator();
    while (li.hasNext()) {
        Product p = (Product) li.next();
        pmd.increasePrice(p, pct);
    }
}

// From ProductManagerDaoJdbc.java in MVC-step-by-step
public void increasePrice(Product prod, int pct) {
    logger.info("Increasing price by " + pct + "%");
    SqlUpdate su = 
        new SqlUpdate(ds, "update products set price = price * (100 + ?) / 100 where id = ?");
    su.declareParameter(new SqlParameter("increase", Types.INTEGER));
    su.declareParameter(new SqlParameter("ID", Types.INTEGER));
    su.compile();
    Object[] oa = new Object[2];
    oa[0] = new Integer(pct);
    oa[1] = new Integer(prod.getId());
    int count = su.update(oa);
    logger.info("Rows affected: " + count);
}
</pre>

<p>In the tutorial, <em>every</em> call to
<code>ProductManagerDaoJdbc.increasePrice()</code> compiles and executes
one SQL query.</p>

<p>In ESXX you would have written method as follows, which compiles the
query only once, when it's first executed, and then updates all product
prices at once each time <code>ProductManager.increasePrice()</code> is
called.</p>

<pre class="example">// From app-form-sql-pm.js
function ProductManager.prototype.increasePrice(pct) {
  this.db.query("UPDATE products SET price = price * (100 + {percent}) / 100",
                { percent: pct });
}</pre>

<p>If you're going to use a relational database, it helps knowing how
they work.</p>


<h3>Black and white?</h3>

<p>Nothing is absolute. Automatic O/R mapping has many benefits, and
database independence is one of them.</p>

<p>It's a bit like REST vs. SOAP-RPC: do you view the web as resources
that can be modified, or objects with methods? I prefer REST, but won't
prevent you from using SOAP; in the same way, I prefer the relational
view, but I will obviously not prevent you from using the RDBMS as an
object store.</p>


<h2>Automatic session handling and continuations</h2>

<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, and that's really a good thing. Writing
web applications the same way you would write a local-only application
will sooner or later end in tears, either for you or for your
users.</p>

<p>Use the protocol to your advantage, and let the database or the
client worry about state. Stateless web applications are almost
indefinitely scalable &mdash; isn't that great? And modern web browsers
and client frameworks makes it painless to run almost all of the UI on
the client.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes you just don't care about scalability. For these
situations, you'll be happy to hear that keeping state on a single node
is as easy as using a global hash object, since ESXX applications are
long-lived on each node.</p>
