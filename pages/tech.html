ESXX, pronounced <em>Essex</em>, is web application server that executes
web applications written in JavaScript on the server-side. It's written
in Java and has <i>no</i> external dependencies except for J2SE 6.0
&mdash; everything else that's required is packaged in one single,
executable JAR file.</p>

<p><em>Simplicity</em> does not have to mean <q>limiting</q>
or <q>incomplete</q>, though. Some of the highlights of ESXX are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>JavaScript 1.7</strong>, provided by Rhino.</dt>
  <dd>Modern JavaScript really is a fantastic language. We'll be tracking
Rhino releases, so expect 1.8 in the future.</dd>

  <dt><strong>E4X extensions</strong></dt>
  <dd>Meaning unparallelled ease of use when working with XML
documents.</dd>

  <dt><strong>XSLT 2.0</strong>, provided by Saxon 9</dt>
  <dd>For state-of-the-art XML transformations with access to
user-defined JavaScript and Java extension functions directly from the
XSLT templates.</dd>

  <dt>Embedded <strong>SQL database</strong> (H2)</dt>
  <dd>For quick prototyping or situations where a non-distributed web
application is simply good enough.</dd>

  <dt>Built-in <strong>web server</strong></dt>
  <dd>Suitable for development and small-scale deployments.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Secure by default</strong></dt>
  <dd>ESXX is designed to make the applications immune to SQL injection
or XSS attacks.  <a

&hellip;</a></dd>

  <dt>Encourages <strong>layer separation</strong>
and <strong>state-less design</strong></dt>
  <dd>Resulting in highly scalable, easily maintainable web
applications.</dd>

  <dt>Ready for the <strong>multi-core</strong> era</dt>
  <dd>Supports multithreaded JavaScript applications with easy-to-use
<strong>fork/join</strong> and <strong>parallel array</strong>
primitives.  <a
href="http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:ESXX_-_ESXX#Methods">More
&hellip;</a></dd>

  <dt>A <strong>RESTful mindset</strong></dt>
  <dd>It encourages good-looking URIs and exposes web
services/resources, local files, LDAP directories and SQL databases
using the same API.</dd>

  <dt>Full access to <strong>J2SE 6</strong></dt>
  <dd>That's thousands of useful classes and arguably one of the best
runtime environments on the planet. Naturally, you can plug in your own
or 3rd party Java code too, as well as native JNI modules.</dd>

  <dt>Remotely controllable via <strong>JMX</strong></dt>
  <dd>Unload or view statistics about running applications directly from
VisualVM or JConsole.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Standards-based</strong></dt>
  <dd>JavaScript, XML, XSLT, SQL, Java &nbsp;&hellip; This is stuff you
probably already know, so you'll be productive in no time.</dd> 
</dl>

<p>Additionally, ESXX can be used to execute JavaScript <strong>script
files</strong> right from the command line.
See <a href="examples.html">here</a> for a few examples.</p>


<h2>What it's not</h2>

<p>ESXX is a small runtime for JavaScript web applications, mainly
intended as a PHP alternative (or, on the small scale, a J2EE
alternative &mdash; web apps do not <em>have</em> to be big and
complicated!). It's not a web application framework, although you could
certainly write one for it.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no built-in object-relational mapper.</li>
<li>There is no automatic session handling or <q>continuations</q>
support.</li>
</ul>

<p>But remember, just because something is not directly available in the
ESXX executable, it doesn't mean it couldn't, or shouldn't, be written
as a JavaScript framework!</p>
